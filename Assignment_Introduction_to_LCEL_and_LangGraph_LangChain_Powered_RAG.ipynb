This means that users can specify what they want to achieve without needing to outline every detail of how to accomplish it. This can make code more readable and easier to maintain.\\n\\n2. **Integration with Language Models**: LECL is designed to work seamlessly with various language models. It allows developers to construct expressions that can leverage the capabilities of these models for tasks like text generation, summarization, data extraction, and more.\\n\\n3. **Data Processing**: LECL can be used for processing structured and unstructured data, facilitating tasks such as filtering, mapping, and transforming data outputs from language models.\\n\\n4. **Custom Functions**: Users can define custom functions within LECL to extend its capabilities, allowing for tailored solutions that fit specific use cases.\\n\\n5. **Use Cases**: LECL can be employed in various applications, including chatbots, data analysis tools, and other forms of interactive applications that require natural language understanding and generation.\\n\\nOverall, LECL is part of LangChain's commitment to making it easier for developers to build applications harnessing the power of language models, providing a powerful toolset for expression and interaction with these models.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 310, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 337, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_80cf447eee', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-0e196158-09de-41f4-bcad-6c818c53f134-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 310, 'total_tokens': 337, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

This preserves the coherence of related information within chunks.\n",

        "2. `Structure-aware chunking`: Parse the document structure (e.g., headers, sections, paragraphs) and split according to the document's inherent organization.

        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",

        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",

        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class State(TypedDict):\n",
        "    question: str\n",
        "    context: list[Document]\n",
        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

            "LCEL, or LangChain Expression Language, is a declarative framework designed to simplify the process of composing chains in LangChain applications. It offers several advantages over traditional coding methods. Here are the key features and benefits:\n",

            "1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Chains created using LCEL automatically support synchronous, asynchronous, batch processing, and streaming functionality. This flexibility allows developers to prototype their chains in a Jupyter notebook with synchronous operations and later deploy them with asynchronous streaming capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Fallbacks**: Given the non-deterministic nature of large language models (LLMs), it's crucial to handle errors effectively. LCEL enables developers to easily integrate fallback mechanisms into any chain, ensuring that the application can gracefully manage unexpected issues.\n",

            "LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) provides robust capabilities for parallel execution, which is crucial for optimizing performance in LLM (Large Language Model) applications. Here are the key features related to parallel execution supported by LCEL:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Automatic Parallel Execution**: LCEL syntax is designed to automatically run any components that can be executed in parallel. This means you can leverage the ability to handle multiple API calls simultaneously, improving the overall efficiency and speed of your applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Support for Asynchronous Operations**: The chains built using LCEL support asynchronous execution. This allows for non-blocking API calls, meaning that while one component is processing, others can run concurrently without waiting for each to complete.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Batch Processing**: LCEL facilitates batch execution, which is useful when you need to process a large set of inputs at once. This capability not only saves time but also optimizes resource utilization.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Streaming Support**: In addition to synchronous and asynchronous operations, LCEL provides streaming support. This is particularly beneficial for applications that require handling data in real-time or streaming contexts, allowing for continuous processing of data as it arrives.\n",
            "\n",

            "1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Chains defined using LCEL inherently support synchronous, asynchronous, batching, and streaming operations.
